## Introduction

This project is a signal processing project to detect fraudulant bananas labelling using multiple data sources. The project was developed as part of the Signal Processing module of the Dorset College.

> [!WARNING]
> The project is not reproductible as is, the data used is private to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The code is provided as a reference for the methodology used.

## Build & Run

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MorganKryze/Bananas-Fraud.git
```

Or download the zip file.

Make sure to be in the project's directory:

```bash
cd Bananas-Fraud
```

Then, install the dependencies (I recommend using a virtual environment like `venv` or `conda`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have access to the dataset, rename the folder to `data` and place it in the project's root directory. It should contain a `Treated_samples` and `Untreated_samples` folders.

Finally, run the Jupyter notebook with your environment.
